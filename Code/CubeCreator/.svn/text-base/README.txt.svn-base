OVERVIEW
--------
The CubeCreator can be used to create data that can be imported into
Opticks.  It supports creating a variety of different cubes.  Please
run the executable with -h or --help to see the options available
when creating a cube.  The created cube will be written to the current
directory.  Where possible, the CubeCreator will also create an ENVI
header which allows importing the cube directly into Opticks.
