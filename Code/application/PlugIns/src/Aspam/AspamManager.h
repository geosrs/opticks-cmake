 *  the Aspam data type with ModelServices. When a new Aspam is created
 *  by ModelServices, an Any data element is created. The stay resident
 *  instance of this plug-in is used to populate the AnyData portion of the
 *  Aspam's Any element. An example can be seen in AspamImporter.
 *
 *  This plug-in also handles clean up of the AnyData portions when it is destroyed.
 *  Do not destroy the plug-in instance manually or any existing Aspam Any elements
 *  will have their AnyData portions deleted and set to NULL.
