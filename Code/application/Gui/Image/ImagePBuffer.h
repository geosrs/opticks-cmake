*  data to an offscreen color buffer. This class uses
*  the OpenGL pbuffer extension to provide support for
*  offscreen rendering. When using the pbuffer extension
*  to render data to an offscreen buffer, OpenGL context
*  switching happens. Also, when the pbuffer is created,
*  its pixel format is highly dependent on the graphics
*  driver. Auxilary buffers may also be created when the
*  pbuffer is created which takes up more video memory.
*  The creation of the auxilary buffers seems to be dependent
*  on the graphics driver.
