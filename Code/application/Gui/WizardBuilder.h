/**
 *  A widget in which to chain plug-in and desktop service items together in sequence
 *  to create a wizard.
 *
 *  The WizardBuilder widget allows sequencing of plug-ins, desktop services, and
 *  specific values by manipulating items on a canvas displayed in a view widget.  The
 *  wizard builder looks similar to an application in that it has its own menu bar,
 *  toolbar, and status bar.  The central part of the wizard builder is split into
 *  several widgets: the view containing the items, dock windows displaying properties
 *  of the wizard and selected wizard item, and a dock window containing a palette of
 *  all items that can be added to the wizard.
 *
 *  The palette dock window contains a list of available wizard items arranged by type.
 *  For convenience, it also has a tab that displays all items simultaneously.  Multiple
 *  items can be selected and dragged onto the view widget to add the items to the wizard.
 *  Multiple items are added in a cascading fashion.
 *
 *  The view widget displays the desktop, plug-in, and specific value items.  The items
 *  contain various input and output arguments that can be connected to form a
 *  sequence of events.  Selected items have a context menu containing actions relevant
 *  to the items, and the view itself has a separate context menu containing actions
 *  relevant to the wizard.
 *
 *  Each item has a unique execution order identifier.  The order may be incremented for
 *  an item with the increaseCurrentItemOrder() and decreaseCurrentItemOrder() methods.
