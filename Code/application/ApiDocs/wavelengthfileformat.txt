/** \page wavelengthfileformat Wavelength File Format Specification
\section wavelengthtextimporter Wavelength Text Importer
Loads wavelength values from a file.

The Wavelength %Text %Importer loads start, center, and end wavelength values
from a file in one of the following ASCII text file formats:
- <b>One column</b> - One column of data containing the center wavelengths for
                      the bands, in band order.
- <b>Two column</b> - Two columns of data containing the band number in the
                      first column (assumes band numbers begin at 1, and 1 will
                      be subtracted from each band number; if a 0 is found,
                      assumes band numbers begin at 0), and the center
                      wavelength in the second column.
- <b>Three columns</b> - Three columns of data containing the center wavelength
                         in the first column, the lower (or starting) wavelength
                         in the second column, and the upper (or ending)
                         wavelength in the third column; all data must be in
                         band order.
- <b>Four columns</b> - Four columns of data containing the band number in the
                        first column (assumes band numbers begin at 1, and 1
                        will be subtracted from each band number; if a 0 is
                        found, assumes band numbers begin at 0), the center
                        wavelength in the second column, the lower (or starting)
                        wavelength in the third column, and the upper (or
                        ending) wavelength in the fourth column.

The columns are delimited by any size whitespace.  %Any line starting with #
is assumed to be a comment.

For three and four column formats, the order within the file of the start,
center, and end wavelengths is determined by looking at the first row of
data, assuming that the start wavelength is less than the center
wavelength, which is less than the end wavelength.

The data is populated in a Wavelengths object.  Since the Wavelengths
object does not contain band information, any band numbers in the file are
ignored and the wavelengths are assumed to be in the correct band order.
The start values, center values, and end values vectors will be empty if
the data is not read in from the file.

\deprecated  This file format is deprecated and is provided solely to load
             existing wavelength files.  New wavelength files should be saved
             and loaded with the Wavelength Metadata %Exporter and Wavelength
             Metadata %Importer.
