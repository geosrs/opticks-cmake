This tutorial will build on \ref plugintutorial3.
We'll add an option to constrain processing to an AOI.

If you would like to run this tutorial as you follow along with the code, see \ref RunningTutorial.
If you would like to build and experiment with this tutorial as you follow along with the code, see \ref plugintutorial_building.
If you are running this tutorial in %Opticks, you will need to select "Tutorial 4" from the Tutorial toolbar to execute it.

\dontinclude Tutorial/Tutorial4.cpp

\skip isBatch
\until }
We are adding a new input argument for an AoiElement.
The plug-in only provides this argument when running in batch mode. 

\skip AoiElement
\until }
This extracts the AOI argument if the plug-in is being executed in batch mode.

\skip pModel
\until pAois
This code gets a list of all the AoiElements which are children of the RasterElement.
When a type string is required, TypeConverter will generate the correct string given a data type.
This guarantees a compile time check for a correct type.

\until } // end if
We are creating a Qt string list of all the available AOI names including a placeholder for no AOI selection.
A QInputDialog presents the user with an AOI choice.
We find the chosen AOI with some validation.

\skip startRow
\until }
\skip setRows
\until setColumns
If an AOI is chosen, we can be more efficient in accessing the cube data.
We only need to loop over the AOI's bounding box.
An AOI can be accessed as a bitmask.
The bitmask can either represent selected pixels or unselected pixels.
The BitMask::isOutsideSelected() method indicates if the bitmask is negated.
If so, we need to loop over the entire image.

\skip unsigned int col
\until nextRow
We only add the pixel to the statistics counters if it is masked by the AOI.
We can ignore BitMask::isOutsideSelected() since BitMask::getPixel() already considers this.

The remainder of the file is unchanged from the previous tutorial.
