    *   Transcription and Translation:

    *   Notes:
    *     -# Error correcting code, convergence failure traps, antipodal
    *        corrections, polar error corrections, and WGS84 ellipsoid
    *        parameters written by Michael Kleder, 2004.
    *     -# Vincenty describes his original algorithm as precise to within
    *        0.01 millimeters, subject to the ellipsoidal model.
    *     -# Essentially antipodal points are treated as exactly
    *        antipodal, potentially reducing accuracy by a small amount.
    *     -# Failures for points exactly at the poles are eliminated by
    *        moving the points by 0.6 millimeters.
    *     -# This algorithm uses an ellipsoidal earth model and is,
    *        therefore, more accurate than a spherical Earth model. The
    *        maximum differences between this algorithm and the spherical
    *        earth algorithm is:
