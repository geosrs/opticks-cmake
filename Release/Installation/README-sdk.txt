Overview
--------
The SDK allows you to build plug-ins for Opticks.  If you downloaded the 
.tar.bz2 version of the SDK, you will be able to build plug-ins for Solaris
10.  If you downloaded the .zip version of the SDK, you will be able to
build plug-ins for Windows.  In order to run any plug-ins that you build, you
will need to download and install Opticks for your platform.

You can read the rest of the SDK documentation by opening the
doc\html\index.html file in a web browser.  You will find a link to developer
tutorials on the main page.
