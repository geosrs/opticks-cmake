        <p class="BodyText">The Opticks Quick-Look Data Fusion Plug-In fuses data from 
 various sensors such as EO and Thermal IR, even if they were taken at 
 different angles, skewed, rotated, or translated. This next-generation 
 tool features faster performance and better memory management. It interacts 
 with all of Opticks' features. This tool was originally designed to function 
 with GeoTIFF and NITF imagery, but any data that is supported by Opticks 
 and contains georeferencing information can be used.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">While the plug-in is capable of fusing any two data sets, 
 there are some restrictions:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: square;" type="square">
            <li class="BodyText">Only the first band of 
 the Secondary Data set is fused with the Primary Data Set. </li>
            <li class="BodyText">Only data sets with georeferencing 
 information can be fused. Datasets lacking georeferencing information 
 can be georeferenced using GCP (Ground Control Point) lists provided with 
 Opticks, or by a custom Georeference Plug-in.</li>
            <li class="BodyText">The Opticks interfaces 
 allow you to add views containing multiple data sets. Some importers or 
 algorithms may create special views that will not accurately represent 
 the data to be fused. The side-by-side view is one such view. This is 
 why you cannot fuse a side-by-side view with another data set. Some of 
 the standard importers provided by the Opticks core fall under this category.</li>
            <li class="BodyText">To save products with 
 geolocation information, use the GeoTIFF Product Exporter. Any problems 
 with exporting products should be directed to the Opticks Help Desk.</li>
            <li class="BodyText">Some releases of Opticks 
 will have “Not for Production Use” or “For Software Development Only” 
 in addition to normal classification markings. These releases have not 
 been tested or DODIIS certified and should not be used in operational 
 environments. </li>
        </ul>
