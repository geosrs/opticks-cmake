        <h2><span style="x-text-overline: off;x-text-line-through: off;text-underline: none;text-decoration: none none none;">Understanding 
 the Georeferencing Process</span>
        </h2>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <MadCap:keyword term="georeferencing" />The georeference algorithm calculates a coordinate grid 
 by entering the GCPs into a mathematical polynomial fit equation of the 
 order that you specify. This method tends to stretch the coordinates to 
 fit the given GCPs, always introducing some level of error. This error 
 is known as root mean square (RMS) error, and it defines the level of 
 accuracy for the georeference calculations.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">After the georeference transformation is complete, the 
 new latitude/longitude coordinates are interpolated across the data pixels. 
 This means that every mouse cursor position over the data set will have 
 a precise latitude/longitude coordinate value. The new coordinates are 
 displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the main application window, 
 as you move the mouse over a pixel.</p>
        <h2><span style="x-text-overline: off;x-text-line-through: off;text-underline: none;text-decoration: none none none;">Selecting 
 a New Set of Ground Control Points</span>
        </h2>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <MadCap:keyword term="ground control point;GCP" />A ground control point (GCP) is a set of two coordinates, 
 a pixel coordinate and a latitude/longitude coordinate. You can also manually 
 type in either of the coordinates. A GCP is selected in a two-step process 
 where the pixel coordinate is selected immediately before or after the 
 latitude/longitude coordinate.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The GCP list defines all of the matching sets of destination 
 and reference coordinates. It is managed entirely within the GCP Editor. 
 List management capabilities include creating a GCP list, adding a GCP, 
 deleting a GCP, editing pre-existing GCPs, and saving a list. All of these 
 capabilities are available within the dialog except for saving the GCP 
 list.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">A GCP can be entered manually with the keyboard, graphically 
 with the mouse, or with a combination of both methods. The destination 
 coordinate and the reference coordinate must be entered one after the 
 other, but either one can be entered first. </p>
        <h2><span style="x-text-overline: off;x-text-line-through: off;text-underline: none;text-decoration: none none none;">Understanding 
 RMS Error</span>
        </h2>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <MadCap:keyword term="RMS error" />When the georeference algorithm calculates a latitude/longitude 
 grid from the GCPs, the location of the GCP on the grid is sometimes displaced 
 from its actual ground location. This displacement is a measurable error 
 called root mean square (RMS) error. The error is a result of a mathematical 
 transformation process in which a pixel’s location on a latitude/longitude 
 coordinate grid is measured against individual GCP locations.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The pixel latitude/longitude coordinates are calculated 
 based on a least squares regression of the data. The resulting RMS error 
 is displayed in the “x” and “y” directions, as well as the total overall 
 RMS error. The error values are in units of pixels, so an RMS error of 
 5 means that the latitude/longitude coordinates for a predicted point 
 for the GCP is within a 5-pixel radius of the original. The actual latitude/longitude 
 accuracy depends on the accuracy of the GCPs.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">An acceptable level of RMS error varies from one data 
 set to another, depending upon the spatial resolution of the pixels. A 
 general rule of thumb is to have an RMS error of less than 1 pixel. The 
 spatial resolution of the Landsat scene used for this training exercise 
 is 28.5 meters. Therefore, if the RMS error is less than 1 pixel, the 
 error would correspond to an accuracy of 28.5 meters for scaling purposes.</p>
